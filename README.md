# Unusual Beliefs

belief is another word for mental model, and one mental model is better than another if it’s more useful and accurate in explaining and predicting.

beliefs should be driven by evidence (instead of values or ideology or peers or incentives).

guidelines: reference both evidence for and against each idea, etc.

good evidence minimizes bad/biased arguments, such as these… there is a hierarchy of evidence.

- diet: meat, fat, vegetable oils, etc.
- free will is a constructive illusion
- empathy is sadistic
- hierarchies based on competence and consent are usually good, based on coercion or deception are usually bad.
- ideology is bad, empiricism is good. Judge policies by judging their outcomes, instead of judging the values embodied in the policy, or your predictions of the outcomes. begin a policy this way, but re-judge when outcomes are available.
- good values don’t ensure good outcomes, and can always be twisted be interpreted in a way that justifies the interests of the rationalizer.
- keep your identity small: don’t associate identity with beliefs like “Democrat”
- it’s good to take things for granted… there js a reason we evolved to do thi
- humans can rationalize just about anything. morality evolved to do two things: pro-social behavior, and self-justification of interests.
- the verb “is” is insidious… structures our ideas of the world as if our perceptions are correct.
- here is no such thing as objective truth, only common subjectivity.
- people feel good going from SAD to vegetarian or vegan because they are no longer eating bad stuff, not because they are taking care of all their nutrition. many eventually have nutrient deficiencies.
