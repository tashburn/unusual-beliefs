# Unusual Beliefs (Draft)

belief is another word for mental model, and one mental model is better than another if it’s more useful and accurate in explaining and predicting.

beliefs should be driven by evidence (instead of values or ideology or peers or incentives).

guidelines: reference both evidence for and against each idea, etc.

good evidence minimizes bad/biased arguments, such as these… there is a hierarchy of evidence.

If you want to see the world as clearly as possible, you need to ciltivate an attitude of being independent minded… look at original evidence… don’t use social proof, don’t fall for bad arguments, add accurate confidence levels to each of your beliefs, have a constructive detachment… keep your identity small….

- diet: meat, fat, vegetable oils, etc.
  - saturated/monounsaturated fat (animals, olive oil, coconut oil) is best for longevity: https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/70/10/1181/2605464
- free will is a constructive illusion
- empathy can be sadistic
- hierarchies based on competence and consent are usually good, based on coercion or deception are usually bad.
- ideology is bad, empiricism is good. Judge policies by judging their outcomes, instead of judging the values embodied in the policy, or your predictions of the outcomes. begin a policy this way, but re-judge when outcomes are available.
- good values don’t ensure good outcomes, and can always be twisted be interpreted in a way that justifies the interests of the rationalizer.
- keep your identity small: don’t associate identity with beliefs like “Democrat”
- it’s good to take things for granted… there js a reason we evolved to do thi
- humans can rationalize just about anything. morality evolved to do two things: pro-social behavior, and self-justification of interests.
- the verb “is” is insidious… structures our ideas of the world as if our perceptions are correct.
- here is no such thing as objective truth, only common subjectivity.
- people feel good going from SAD to vegetarian or vegan because they are no longer eating bad stuff, not because they are taking care of all their nutrition. many eventually have nutrient deficiencies.
- most disagreements are about the definitions of words.
- controversies and difficult decisions are contests of good values. What's the best balance?
- everyone should be a political independent. keep your identity small.

- for each value you have, it's good to know when it's too much, where it crosses the line. any virtue taken to an extreme becomes a vice.
- for each belief you have, it's good to acknowledge what evidence it's based on, and what evidence would change your mind.
- a good way to deal with paranoid conspiracy theorists is to ask them what evidence their belief is based on. when it's clear that their evidence is weak, or it's based on social proof, leverage their paranoia: "Your beliefs aren't based on good evidence. That makes you easy to manipulate."



Ask HN: What are your unusual beliefs?

Here are some of mine:

- a sin of omission is just as unethical as the equivalent sin of commission.

- compassion is better than empathy, where empathy is "feeling another's feelings" and compassion is "understanding another's feelings without feeling them."

- taking things for granted has its benefits. it's impossible to appreciate everything all the time because your attention has limited capacity. chose wisely what and when to appreciate.

- free will is a constructive illusion

- most disagreements are really about the definitions of words

- "Every virtue carried to the extreme, is a vice" - Aristotle

- controversies and difficult decisions are contests of values. in the absence of a creative solution, try identifying the values and balancing them.

- correlation *does* imply causation. if "correlation doesn't imply causation", then what does? all we really have is correlation. we infer causation when correaltions are consistent, proximal in space and time, and when rival causations seem less plausible. but it's merely an inference with some level of confidence. this is similar to the philosophical science argument that we can't technically prove anything, we can only fail to disprove.

- anything whose presence is required for an outcome is rightfully one of its "causes".
