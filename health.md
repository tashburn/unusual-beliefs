# Diet
- Best macronutrient ratio: high fat, medium protein, low carb (be a "Lipovore")
- Avoid: alcohol, fructose, vegetable oils
- Salt is good and doesn't raise BP unless you have high insulin (e.g. from a carby diet)
- A good diet is modest in calories, low glycemic index, nutrient-dense, unprocessed, and eaten in time window of 8 hours of less (with the rest of the day a water fast).
- Ketones are neuroprotective, brain's use of them doesn't decline with age like glucose
- Get fat mostly from olive oil, fatty animal/seafood protein, avocados, and coconut oil.
- Coconut oil is very healthy except 30% of it is long-chain fatty acid (pro-inflammatory, triggers immune system). Mitigate by consuming with vegetables that have short-chain fatty acids, like leeks, onions, garlic, asparagus.
- Get protein mostly from animal/seafood
- Get cards from nutrient-dense low-calorie veggies like lettuces, cruciferous vegetables, and avocados.
- If you need a treat, do a little of berries or cheese, occasionally.
- Benefits of keto:
  - better mental clarity
  - stabler moods
  - consistent, endless energy
  - better physical endurance
  - get sick less often
  - lower cancer risk
  - longer lifespan
  - longer healthspan
  - no hanger,
  - autophagy
- Do Intermittant Fasting or Time-Restricted Feeding (see Fasting)
- Avoid emuksifiers like soy lecithin in processed foods. It erodes mucosal lining and blunts satiety hormones, leading to over eating.

# Supplements
- Most don't work, some do damage, some contain wrong amounts or unlabeled ingredients.
- Common deficiencies: Vitamin D (especially in winter), Magnesium, Potassium, Zinc


# Fasting
- Benefits: weight loss, autophagy, insulin control, tune gut microbiome, control cravings, repair gut, dopamine reset
- A daily time-restricted window is good! The tighter the window the better. Ideally, early in the day.
- Consume water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium)
- Timeline
  - at 13 hours, growth hormone begins to be released
  - at 17 hours, autophagy starts
  - at 24 hours, intestinal stem cell repair
  - at 72 hours, systemic stem cells kick in
  - at 36 hours, start to burn significant fat
  - at 36 hours, reboot immune system
  - at 48 hours, dopamine reset
  - at 72 hours, autophagy peaks
  - at 72 hours, get meaningful fat loss
- Break fast with fat like olive oil, avocado, bone broth. Keep protein under 20g for next 24h. This reduces hunger and keeps body in autophagy longer.
- 24h after breaking a fast, mtor is very active. To build muscle, consume a lot of protein for the next 3 days.

- To detox, sweat a lot.
- Variations: push the length, vary the length
- During a fast, monitor glucose and ketones. If glucose drops to 45, or ketones rise to 7, consume some fat. If those numbers persist, stop the fast.
- Hacks:
  - spoon of fat to turn off hunger
  - bone broth
  - for autophagy: red light therapy, hyperbaric oxygen
  - Gerolsteiner (mineral water)
  - Fastonic to reduce detox symptoms
  - BIND activated charcoal for detox symptoms
  - cytosetox for neuro detox symptoms like headache, agitation, trouble sleeping, metal taste
  - exogenous ketones
  - LMNT for electrolytes
  - MIN for electrolytes

# Sleep
- Go to sleep 2 hours after sun down, wake up with the sun
- Have a consistent schedule, even on weekends.
- Haev a consistent warm-down-for-bed routine.
- Make the room pitch black dark.
- Make the room 65 degrees.
- Have red light only for the 2 hours before bed (no unfiltered screens!).
- Only use bed for sleep and sex.
- Avoid caffeine, even in the morning. While the half-life is 5 hours, the quarter-life is 12 hours.
- Avoid alcohol in the evening because it disrupts sleep, circadian rhythm, and HGH (wastes workouts!).
- Don't eat within 3 hours of bed.
- Equipment: eye mask, chilipad.


# Exercise
- Exercise every day, in some way, even if it's just a walk/hike.
- If you miss a day, it's not a big deal. Life will happen.
- HIIT 15-20 minutes (go all out for 30s, rest for 90s).
- Get both cardio and resistance.
- Resistance training:
  - Should work all the major muscle groups.
  - 70% of your max-load seems to be optimal for building muscle.
  - Reps to failure, or 80% of failure.
- It's 10x easier to stay lean from diet than from exercise.
- It's more time-efficient to do easy/hard efforts, rather than medium efforts.
- Stay psychologically motivated:
  - pick workouts i like.
  - get enough variety.
  - adjust duration, intensity, and frequency to tolerance.
