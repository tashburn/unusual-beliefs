# Diet
- Best macronutrient ratio: high fat, medium protein, low carb
- Avoid: alcohol, fructose, vegetable oils
- Salt is good and doesn't raise BP unless you have high insulin (e.g. from a carby diet)


# Supplements
- Common deficiencies: Vitamin D (especially in winter), Magnesium, Potassium, Zinc


# Fasting
- Benefits: weight loss, autophagy, insulin control, tune gut microbiome, control cravings, repair gut, dopamine reset
- A daily time-restricted window is good! The tighter the window the better. Ideally, early in the day.
- Consume water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium)

  - at 72 hours, stem cells kick in
  - at 36 hours, start to burn significant fat
  - at 48 hours, dopamine reset
  - at 72 hours, autophagy peaks
  - at 72 hours, get meaningful fat loss
  - 
- Break fast with fat (which kills hunger and keeps body in autophagy) and keep protein under 20g for next 24h
